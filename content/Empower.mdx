<p className="lead my-4 text-sm-start text-cter">
    CyVerse cyberinfrastructure provides scalable solutions for science in the age of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You don’t have to maintain your own servers, pay for IT services, or worry about security and replication – we’ll take care of that for you. Our hardware, software, and staff enable you to easily store, share, and analyze large amounts of data for the scientific discoveries that may lie within. </p>
    <p className="lead text-sm-start text-cter">See all the different ways we empower our users below:

        <h3>For Researchers</h3>
        <p className="lh-base">
          A researcher is trying to analyze NEON Lidar data and drone imagery. His home internet connection is too slow to handle these large datasets. After signing up for a CyVerse account, he is able to start a Virtual Machine in the Discovery Environment/VICE running GPUs with 40 core and 256GB RAM. He then uses the fast connections of the VM to download his data to the VM and analyze the data on CyVerse.

        <h3>For Collaborators</h3>
        <p className="lh-base">
          A team of astrophysicists wants to directly observe and create a picture of a black hole. The Event Horizon Telescope’s international team of over 200 collaborators reconstructs an image of a black hole from some of the project’s data stored, shared, and analyzed at CyVerse. The team published in 2020 this first-ever image of a black hole and they continue to hone their imaging algorithms, anticipating that they soon will be able to take the first actual picture of a black hole.

        <h3>For Developers</h3>
        <p className="lh-base">
          A software developer with a keen interest in microbial ecology creates his own Docker application for a statistical microbial analysis. Through CyVerse’s Foundational Open Science Skills course, he connected with a working group tackling the same dataset. Their resulting collaboration led to the publication of a new, open access tool elevating the pace of microbial ecology for researchers everywhere.

        <h3>For Training</h3>
        <p className="lh-base">
          For Training: A graduate student is having a hard time finding curricula that provide the computational science and data analysis training she needs for her program. CyVerse's Container Camp and Foundational Open Science Skills courses bring attendees the full curriculum, from learning the basic principles, practices, and how-tos for doing collaborative open science using cutting-edge, open source cyberinfrastructure, to using cloud and high-performance computing (HPC) resources in their own labs.

        <p className="lh-base">
          An instructor of an undergraduate molecular biology course was faced with drastic changes when coursework shifted online in 2020. While trying to figure out how to lead a large-scale, flexible, online research and data analysis class, she discovered CyVerse. With seamless access for the students regardless of their personal computers, CyVerse provided a consistent environment to host virtual lab sessions for hundreds of students.

<p class="lead my-4">
    CyVerse has a proven track record for being a reputable resource for
    cyberinfrasturcture services. You are more competitive using CyVerse rather
    than standing up services on your own. You don’t have to maintain your own
    servers, pay for IT services, or worry about security and replication.
    CyVerse takes care of that for you. </p>
    <p class="lead">See all the different ways we empower our users below:

        <h3>For Researchers</h3>
        <p class="lh-base">
          A high school student is trying to analyze NEON Lidar data and drone
          imagery. His home internet connection is too slow to handle these
          large datasets. After signing up for a CyVerse account, he was able to
          start a Virtual Machine in VICE running GPUs with 40 core and 256GB
          RAM. He then uses the fast connections of the VM to download his data
          to the VM and analyze the data on CyVerse.

        <h3>For Collaborators</h3>
        <p class="lh-base">
          A long-standing goal in astrophysics is to directly observe and image
          (i.e., create a picture) of a black hole. To that end, the Event
          Horizon Telescope’s international team of collaborators published in
          2020 the first-ever image of a black hole, reconstructed from some of
          the project’s data stored, shared, and analyzed at CyVerse. The EHT
          continues to hone their imaging algorithms, anticipating that they
          will soon be able to take the first actual picture of a black hole.

        <h3>For Developers</h3>
        <p class="lh-base">
          Software developers craft the tools of modern science, and
    CyVerse provides the collaboration space where they can get creative,
    connect with end users, and publish their products. A developer with a keen
    interest in microbial ecology was crafting his own Docker application for an
    R package to run a microbiome analysis. Through CyVerse’s Foundational Open
    Science Skills course, he found an entire working group of ecologists
    attempting to do what he had already done. The resulting collaboration led
    to the publication of a brand new, open access tool to elevate the progress
    of microbial ecology for researchers everywhere.

        <h3>For Training</h3>
        <p class="lh-base">
          Today, all science is computer science, yet many curricula
    don’t provide the computational science and data analysis training
    researchers need to get work done. CyVerse's Container Camp and Foundational
    Open Science Skills courses bring attendees the full curriculum, from
    learning the basic principles, practices, and how-tos for doing
    collaborative open science using cutting-edge, open source
    cyberinfrastructure, to using cloud and high-performance computing (HPC)
    resources in their own labs.

      <p>CyVerse’s magic starts with the Discovery Environment (DE), a simple web interface for managing data, running analyses, and visualizing and sharing results. Apps in the DE’s Visual and Interactive Compute Environment (VICE) allow you to apply basic deep and machine learning techniques to your data, and use integrated development environments (IDEs) for interacting with your data with reproducible workflows.</p>
      <p>Thousands of open source informatics applications are available for immediate use. You also have the power to integrate new workflows and apps directly into the DE with our platform, share them with collaborators, and with the community.</p>
      <p>Our Visual and Interactive Computing Environment (VICE) enables interactive, at-scale data analysis and output for visualization in real time using Jupyter, RStudio, Shiny, etc., right from your browser. Educators can reserve training resources to use and share VICE images for classes, labs,and workshops, giving students consistent, reproducible containerized workflows to analyze their own datasets.</p>

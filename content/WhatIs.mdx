  <p class="lead text-white">
    <span class="fw-bold">Cyberinfrastructure</span>, also called CI or
    computational infrastructure,provides scalable solutions to doing science in
    the age of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Physical
    infrastructure, such as labs, sequencing centers, and greenhouses, makes it
    easy to generate huge amounts of data. But it takes CyVerse
    cyberinfrastructure—the hardware, software, and people of CyVerse—to enable
    you to easily store, share, and analyze those data for the scientific
    discoveries that may lie within.
  </p>
  <p class="lead text-light">
    <span class="fw-bold">With CyVerse</span>, you and your collaborators can
    now tackle previously unapproachable research questions whose computational
    requirements were either too large, too complex, or simply unknown.

    <div className="my-4">
  <h3>We've been serving the scientific community for over a decade</h3>
  <p className="lh-base">
    <span class="fw-bold">CyVerse was originally created by the National Science Foundation in 2008 with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve U.S. plant science communities.</span> From its inception, iPlant quickly grew into a mature organization, providing powerful resources and offering scientific and technical support services to researchers nationally and internationally. In 2015, iPlant was rebranded as CyVerse to emphasize an expanded mission to serve all life sciences as our cyberinfrastructure is germane to all life sciences disciplines. By democratizing access to supercomputing capabilities, CyVerse provides a crucial resource to enable scientists to find solutions for the future. We rely upon your feedback to ensure we provide the infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and educational agenda. Community-driven needs shape our mission and our services.
